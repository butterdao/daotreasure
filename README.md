# Spread

DAO treasuries comprise the entirety of the resources available to a DAO and carry **significant risk of downside exposure to prolonged bouts of market volatility.**

Often treasury value is concentrated in one or a few tokens, typically the governance token, creating an existential risk around the DAOs ability to achieve its mission and fund ongoing operations.

Spread helps DAOs to spread their treasury into other assets by curating the best and safest diversification strategies, while giving them fine-grained controls over how each strategy is executed.
